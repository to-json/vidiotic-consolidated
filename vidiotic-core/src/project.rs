//! The vidiotic project save format (`.viproj`, RON on disk).
//!
//! On-disk "spec" types are deliberately decoupled from the runtime types
//! (`clippool::Clip`, `bank::Cue`, `bank::Bank`): the file owns a stable, flat
//! clip-id space and flattens the runtime `Toggle<T>` knobs to `Option<T>`, so
//! the format can evolve without dragging the engine's in-memory representation
//! along. Both the player (vidiotic) and the authoring tool (vidiotic-prep) load
//! and save through this one module, so the format has a single source of truth.
//!
//! Serialization is `nanoserde` (RON) — no `serde`/`serde_derive` proc-macro. A
//! `.viproj` is read once per open and written once per save, never in a hot
//! loop, so parser speed is irrelevant; RON is chosen for hand-edit ergonomics
//! (comments, native int/float literals, terse enums).
